# Car_Rental_System

The repo is a dump of a Car Rental system. In our system, Customer can rent a car based on make and a model. Our system provides customer to have different pick-up and drop-off locations and will impose late fee if the rental car is returned beyond the return date and time. The Customers can purchase car rental insurance which is optional.

You can import the files in your database and then try any relatable query and it should work.
